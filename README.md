# Simple Gray Harmonizer

**[View Project](https://brentswisher.github.io/gray-harmonizer/)**

## Project Description

A little web app to simplify the process of harmonizing the grays of a color pallet. 

## What's "Harmonizing the Grays"?
A technique for making a color pallet blend together better. Basically, most pallets consist of a primary color, some accent colors, and a few gray values. Harmonizing the grays takes your gray values, and tints them with one of your main colors. The end result is that it makes all of the colors blend together better and helps the design flow together.

I first discovered it from [Erica Schoonmaker](http://designbyeri.ca/about/) in a [smashing magazine article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/04/web-developer-guide-color/) a while ago, and have used it in almost all of my designs since. What I haven't loved is having to use photoshop to do it, hence this project.
